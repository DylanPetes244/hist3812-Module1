Process of My Artifact  (Justice)

- Took pictures from  phone on artifact in the library, inputting in to Regard3D
- Researched about David Fels, wrote biography about him in repository 
- Write about progess in Regard3D, there is about 32 photos (Will I continue editing this)
- Look at FAQ on adding metadata to pictures
    -To help get information on how to read, write and edit metadata info
- Trying to refer to Basic Principles (Lecture: Intro to Photogrammetry)
    - Embedding metadata into image (Needed to reeducate myself) 
- Using MacBook to add images to Regard3D, challenging (When Things Go Wrong- Syllabus)
- Using Tutorial on Regard3D to find how to upload pictures (Link: http://www.regard3d.org/index.php/documentation/tutorial) 
- Lacking metadata ("The focal length is known for too few pictures. Triangulation will fail")
